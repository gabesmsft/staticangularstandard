The purpose of this Static Web App example is to demo a couple things:
- Bring Your Own Functions: to demo this Functionality, deploy the code that is in the FunctionAppCode-DeploySeparately folder separately, to a Node.js Function App. See [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/functions-bring-your-own) on how to configure Bring Your Own Functions to use your Function App as a backend API for your Static Web App.
-Custom authentication: see the auth section of the staticwebapp.config.json and [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/authentication-custom?tabs=aad).
